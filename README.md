Telecom_classification_project: classification for a telecom company The purpose of this work was to study the possible reasons for the outflow of customers of a telecommunications company. An analysis of the data was carried out, on the basis of which a portrait of the main user of the company's services and the characteristics of the one who uses the least of the services offered by the company was compiled. The most popular and most unpopular services of the company were identified. Most importantly, the factors that have a possible impact on the outflow of customers were identified. I trained several machine learning models, and chose one of them that gave the best accuracy in predicting customer churn(project completed).
